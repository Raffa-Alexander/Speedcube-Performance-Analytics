# Speedcube-Performance-Analytics
I've solved the rubik's cube over 70.000 times since 2018 and I have been tracking all solves with a software. In this project I use python to analyse my progress over time and find ways to improve my performance with the goal of solving the cube with an average time of less than 8 seconds.
