# Speedcube-Performance-Analytics
Project Overview

Since 2018 I have tracked more than 70,000 Rubik's Cube solves using timing software.
This project uses Python to analyze long-term performance trends, consistency metrics, and statistical patterns in order to understand and improve my solving efficiency.

The ultimate goal is to achieve and sustain an average solve time below 8 seconds.

# Objectives
1. Analyze long-term performance trends
2. Measure consistency and variance over time
3. Identify behavioral patterns (time of day, fatigue effects)
4. Track probability of sub-8 performance
5. Apply statistical methods to performance modeling

# Technical Stack
- Python
- Pandas (data processing)
- Plotly (interactive visualization)
- Streamlit (dashboard interface)

# Why This Project?
This project combines:
- Data analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Behavioral performance analysis
- Software development
- It transforms a long-term personal dataset into a quantitative performance study.
