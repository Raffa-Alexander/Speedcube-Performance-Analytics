Since 2018 I have solved the Rubik's Cube over 70,000 times and kept tracking each result with a timing software.

This project uses dynamic dashboards written in Python to analyze long-term performance trends, and statistical patterns in order to understand and improve my solving efficiency.
The ultimate goal is to achieve and sustain an average solve time below 8 seconds.

# Objectives
1. Analyze long-term performance trends
2. Measure consistency and variance over time
3. Identify impact of behavioral patterns on performance:

   a) Day of the week and time of the day

   b) Solves amount per year

   c) Sessions size

5. Track probability of sub-8 performance
6. Apply statistical methods to performance modeling
